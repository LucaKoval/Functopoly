(* Our test plan:

   We wrote black box and glass box tests to ensure our code is correct. 
   Another person in the team wrote black box tests for each memberâ€™s code. 
   And the author of the code was responsible for adding glass box tests in 
   case some edge cases were missed in the other person's test suite because the 
   author is familiar with the code.

   We divide our tests below based on the functional component of our codebase
   it is testing. Each test simulates a part of the gameplay and calls the 
   functions that implement it. We have categorized them below as OUnit tests
   and manual terminal tests.

   OUnit tests:
   1. Parsing the board - board.ml
   2. Converting the indices into tiles - indices.ml
   3. Commands 
    1. Buy
    2. Upgrade
    3. Trade

   Manual tests:
   1. Commands (manually tested since they all do something very simple and there
   is not much to test for them) -
    1. Quit
    2. Roll
    3. Endturn
    4. Help
    5. Inventory

   Proof of correctness: 
   Our pattern match in play_game_recursively in main.ml is exhaustive and 
   contains all the commands a player can enter. As explained above, we have 
   tested the correctness of the implementations of all these commands. We have 
   also tested the step prior to the pattern matching that includes the board 
   parsing and mapping of indices to tiles. Nothing comes after the pattern 
   matching. So we believe we have tested all possible workflows and components.
